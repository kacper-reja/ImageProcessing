# Image Processing

Plant segmentation and labeling app created with Python as a semester project for Image Processing and Computer Vision.

# Libraries

Project is created with the use of the following libraries:

- opencv
- numpy
- matplotlib

# Description

The goal of this project was to perform leaf segmentation from given multi-view dataset containing high resolution images of plants.<br/>
There were five plants and three cameras, photos of each plant were taken six times a day for ten days.<br/><br/>
Based on the observation that all plants in the dataset were in some tone of green color and the background was mainly white, Watershed Algorithm approach was chosen as a solution to given problem.
